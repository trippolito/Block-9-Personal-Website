This project is a career simulation where I will be creating a personal website that displays numerous things
about me as well as some of the projects that I have worked on.  The main goal for this website is to show
my class instructors that I have a general understanding of the basics of HTML, CSS, and using GIT to push \
things to a Github Repository.
